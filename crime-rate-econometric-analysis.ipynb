One key area of research focuses on investigating the relationship between the probabilities of apprehension and punishment and crime participation rates. By studying the deterrence effect of the criminal justice system, we can gain valuable insights into the mechanisms behind criminal decision-making and inform policy interventions aimed at reducing crime. Researching the impact of these probabilities on crime participation rates has significant implications for policy and the allocation of resources within the criminal justice system. By understanding how variations in these probabilities influence criminal behaviour, policymakers can develop targeted strategies to enhance deterrence and reduce crime rates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**RESEARCH QUESTION: Do the probabilities of apprehension and punishment affect crime participation rate**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **About the Data**\nThe provided dataset offers an in-depth exploration into the realm of crime dynamics spanning 90 counties within the North Carolina landscape.

We select our OLS model as follows.\n\n**Model:** Ln(crmrte)= β_0+ β_1Ln(prbarr)+ β_2Ln(prbconv)+ β_3 prbpris+µ\n\n**crmrte** is crimes committed per person, this is our dependent variable.\n\n**prbarr** is 'probability' of arrest, directly relates to the likelihood of a person being apprehended by law enforcement. It represents the chance that an individual will be arrested for a specific offense. We take the log as the distribution is log normal hence data will be concentrated in one part leaving a long tail, we take log to make it more normal.\n\n**prbconv** is 'probability' of conviction, indicates the likelihood of a person being found guilty in court. It represents the chance that someone arrested will be convicted and held legally responsible for the offense. We take the log as the distribution is log normal hence data will be concentrated in one part leaving a long tail, we take log to make it more normal.\n\n**prbpris** is ‘probability' of prison sentence, represents the probability of receiving a prison sentence if convicted. It signifies the likelihood of being punished with incarceration rather than alternative forms of punishment, such as fines or probation.\n\n**We expect these independent variables to be negatively related to crime rate or in other words we expect the coefficient of these independent variables to be less than zero.**\n\nGiven that the data category is panel data it is very likely that simple OLS model will suffer from problem of endogeneity caused by unobserved Heterogeneity. “The unobserved dependency of other independent variable(s) is called unobserved heterogeneity and the correlation between the independent variable(s) and the error term (i.e. the unobserved independent variabels) is called endogeneity.”\n\nThere are five assumptions in simple linear regression:\n\nLinearity\nExogeneity\n(a) Homoskedasticity, and (b) Non-autocorrelation\nIndependent Variable are not stochastic\nNo Multicollinearity\nTwo of these assumptions can help us answer if we should be using Pooled OLS or Fixed Effect Model and Random Effect Model. If assumption 2 or 3 or both are violated then Fixed Effect and Random Effect are more suitable than Pooled OLS.\n\n**1. Pooled OLS**\nWe start by importing important libraries and our dataset and our data. Then we start with the Pooled OLS and validate the required assumptions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(lmtest)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(estimatr)\nlibrary(plm)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.263993Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.265644Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.285322Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# loading data\n\ndf <- read_excel(\"/kaggle/input/crimerate/Crime_NorthCarolina.xlsx\")\nhead(df,n=3)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.288273Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.28983Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.429323Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# pooled OLS model\n\nmodel <- lm_robust(log(crmrte) ~ log(prbarr) + log(prbconv) + prbpris, data = df)\nsummary(model)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.432451Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.434192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-16T13:53:15.755021Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We notice all the coefficients are negative except for one which is probability of prison sentence.

Conclusion\nFor this project we were provided with the dataset which includes information on crime in 90 counties in North Carolina, for the years 1981 through 1987. The research question selected was “Do the probabilities of apprehension and punishment affect crime participation rate?”. First we notice that the data category provided to us is panel data, we start by building a simple OLS model and observe that the coefficient of probability of prison sentence is negative which does not align with our assumption. Due to the data being panel data simple OLS model constructed can suffer from inconsistencies and bias. To prove that we should not be using the pooled OLS model that will suffer from problem of endogeneity caused by unobserved Heterogeneity we check our assumption (3a) Homoskedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test and our assumption (3b) Non-autocorrelation using The Durbin-Watson-Test and find observe that the assumption 3 as a whole has been violated and conclude that we should be using Fixed effect or Random effect model for our regression. To select one model from Fixed effect model and Random effect model we use Hausman test which is a statistical test used to compare the consistency and efficiency of two different estimators and select the Fixed Effect Estimator. The R squared value of 0.0811 which indicates we explain 8.11% of variation in our dependent variable.\n\nThe coefficients from our fixed effect model are all negative confirming our initial assumption that all of the independent variables are negatively related to the crime rate or if any of the independent variable increase crime rate will decrease. The coefficient of β_3 is -0.30241 which had a significant impact on the crime rate and could be used by policy makers, implies 1 unit increase in probability of prison sentence will lead to -30.24% change in crime rate. We tested the significance of our coefficients and find that all the independent variables are significant proving yes probabilities of apprehension and punishment do affect crime participation rate.\n\nAlthough we have provided significant results, we acknowledge that R-Squared values is on the small end. We can describe better if we can gather data on unemployment levels and if we want to compare the crime rate in recent years we can utilize the covid cases as well along with education levels as all of these factors are used to better describe the crime rate. If we consider the limitations of fixed effect model we can say that The fixed effect model is not suitable for analyzing the effects of variables that do not change over time within entities (individuals, groups, etc.). These time-invariant variables are absorbed by the fixed effects, and their impact cannot be estimated in the model.","metadata":{}}]}
